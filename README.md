## What are VLA Models in Robotics?

* **Definition:** Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a class of multimodal AI systems specifically designed for robotics and Embodied AI. They integrate visual perception (from cameras/sensors), natural language understanding (from text or voice commands), and action generation (physical movements or digital tasks) into a unified framework. Unlike traditional robotic systems that often treat perception, planning, and control as separate modules, VLAs aim for end-to-end or tightly integrated processing, similar to how the human brain processes these modalities simultaneously. The term "VLA" gained prominence with the introduction of the RT-2 model. Generally, a VLA is defined as any model capable of processing multimodal inputs (vision, language) to generate robotic actions for completing embodied tasks.

* **Core Concepts:** The basic idea is to leverage the powerful capabilities of large models (LLMs and VLMs) pre-trained on internet-scale data and apply them to robot control. This involves "grounding" language instructions and visual perception information in the physical world to generate appropriate robot actions. The goal is to achieve greater versatility, dexterity, generalization ability, and robustness compared to traditional methods or early reinforcement learning approaches, enabling robots to work effectively in complex, unstructured environments like homes.

* **Key Components:**

    * **Vision Encoder:** Processes raw visual input (images, videos, sometimes 3D data), using architectures like ViT, CLIP encoders, DINOv2, SigLIP to extract meaningful features (object recognition, spatial reasoning).
    * **Language Understanding:** Employs LLM components (such as Llama, PaLM, GPT variants) to process natural language instructions, map commands to context, and perform reasoning.
    * **Action Decoder/Policy:** Generates robot actions based on integrated visual and language understanding (e.g., end-effector pose, joint velocities, gripper commands, base movements). This is a significant differentiator between VLAs and VLMs, involving techniques like action tokenization, diffusion models, or direct regression.
    * **Alignment Mechanisms:** Uses strategies like projection layers and cross-attention to bridge the gap between different modalities, aligning visual, language, and action representations.

* **Relationship to VLMs and Embodied AI:** VLAs are a specialized category within the field of Embodied AI. They extend Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by explicitly incorporating action generation capabilities. VLMs primarily focus on understanding and generating text based on visual input, while VLAs leverage this understanding to interact with the physical world.

* **Evolution from VLM Adaptation to Integrated Systems:** Early VLA research focused mainly on adapting existing VLMs by simply fine-tuning them to output action tokens (e.g., the initial concept of RT-2 ). However, the field is moving towards more integrated architectures where the action generation components are more sophisticated and co-designed (e.g., diffusion policies, specialized action modules, hierarchical systems like Helix  or NaVILA ). This evolution indicates that the definition of VLA is shifting from merely fine-tuning VLMs to designing specific VLA architectures that better address the unique requirements of robot action generation, while still leveraging the capabilities of VLMs.

### By Technical Approach

#### Model Architectures

Focuses on the core neural network architectures used in VLA models.

* **Transformer-based:** The dominant architecture, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to integrate vision, language, and action sequences. 
Used in [RT-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06817), [RT-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15818), [Octo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12213), [OpenVLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09246), [VIMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03094),[ QUART](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14457), etc.

* **Diffusion-based:** Primarily for the action generation component, utilizing the ability of diffusion models to model complex distributions. 
Often combined with a Transformer backbone. E.g., [Diffusion Policy](https://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu/), [Octo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12213) (can use diffusion head), [3D Diffuser Actor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10885), [SUDD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14535v2), [MDT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05996v1), [RDT-1B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07864v2), [DexVLA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05855), 
[DiVLA](https://diffusion-vla.github.io/), [TinyVLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12514), [Hybrid VLA+Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10631).


* **Hierarchical / Decoupled:** Architectures that separate high-level reasoning/planning (often VLM/LLM-based) from low-level control/execution 
(which may be a separate policy). E.g., [Helix](https://www.figure.ai/news/helix) (System 1/2), [NaVILA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04453) (VLA + Locomotion Policy), [Hi Robot](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19417) (VLM + Ï€0), [SayCan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01691) (LLM + Value Function).

* **State-Space Models (SSM):** Emerging architectures like Mamba are being explored for their efficiency. E.g., [RoboMamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04339).

* **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE / MoLE):** Using sparsely activated expert modules for task adaptation or efficiency. 
E.g., [MoRE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08007) (Mixture-of-Robotic-Experts using LoRA). Componentized architecture in [CogACT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19650) . [Ï€0](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0) uses an MoE-like structure.

* **Architectural Diversification for Capability and Efficiency:** While Transformers are foundational, their limitations in handling continuous actions, computational cost, and reasoning depth are driving researchers to explore alternative or hybrid architectures. Diffusion models excel at action generation, hierarchical systems improve reasoning/control separation, SSMs promise efficiency, and MoEs aim for adaptive specialization. This diversification indicates an active search for architectures better suited to the specific constraints and needs of robotics than those designed purely for vision-language tasks. This has led to the emergence of hybrid and specialized designs to address the unique challenges of real-time control, action modeling, efficiency, and complex reasoning in robotics.

#### Action Representation & Generation

Focuses on how robot actions are represented (e.g., discrete tokens vs. continuous vectors) and how models generate them. This is a key area differentiating VLAs from VLMs.

* **Action Tokenization / Discretization:** Representing continuous actions (e.g., joint angles, end-effector pose) as discrete tokens, often via binning.
Used in early/many Transformer-based VLAs like [RT-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06817), [RT-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15818) to fit the language modeling paradigm. May have limitations in precision and high-frequency control.

* **Continuous Action Regression:** Directly predicting continuous action vectors. 
Sometimes used in conjunction with other methods or implemented via specific heads. L1 regression is used in [OpenVLA-OFT](https://openvla-oft.github.io/).

* **Diffusion Policies for Actions:** Modeling action generation as a denoising diffusion process. 
Good at capturing multi-modality and continuous spaces. E.g., [Diffusion Policy](https://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu/), [Octo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12213) (diffusion head), [SUDD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14535v2), [MDT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05996v1), [RDT-1B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07864v2), [DexVLA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05855), [DiVLA](https://diffusion-vla.github.io/), [TinyVLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12514). Can be slow due to iterative sampling.

* **Flow Matching:** An alternative generative method for continuous actions, used in [Ï€0](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0) for efficient, high-frequency (50Hz) trajectory generation.

* **Action Chunking:** Predicting multiple future actions in a single step, for efficiency and temporal consistency. 
Used in [CogACT](https://cogact.github.io/), [RoboAgent](https://robopen.github.io/), [Ï€0](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0), [PD-VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02310). Increases action dimensionality and inference time when using AR decoding.

* **Parallel Decoding:** Techniques to speed up autoregressive decoding of action chunks. E.g., [PD-VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02310).

* **Specialized Tokenizers:** Developing better ways to tokenize continuous action sequences. 
E.g., [FAST](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09747), designed for dexterous, high-frequency tasks.

* **Point-based Actions:** Using VLMs to predict keypoints or goal locations rather than full trajectories. 
E.g., [PIVOT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07872), [RoboPoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10721), [ReKep](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01652).

* **Mid-Level Language Actions:** Generating actions as natural language commands to be consumed by a lower-level policy. E.g., [NaVILA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04453).

* **Action Generation as a Core VLA Challenge:** The diversity and rapid evolution of action representation/generation techniques highlight its importance and difficulty. The limitations of simple tokenization are driving innovations like diffusion models, flow matching, specialized tokenizers, and parallel decoding to balance precision, efficiency, and compatibility with large sequence models. This focus indicates that effectively translating high-level understanding into low-level physical control may be *the* core challenge that VLAs must address to move beyond standard VLM capabilities. Success requires a shift from simple VLM adaptation to action modeling techniques specifically designed for robotics.

#### Learning Paradigms

Focuses on how VLA models are trained and adapted.

* **Imitation Learning (IL) / Behavior Cloning (BC):** Dominant paradigm, training VLAs to mimic expert demonstrations (often from teleoperation). 
Used for [RT-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06817), [RT-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15818), [OpenVLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09246) pre-training, [Octo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12213), [Diffusion Policy](https://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu/), etc. Heavily reliant on large-scale, diverse, high-quality datasets. Performance is often limited by the quality of the demonstrations.

* **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Used to fine-tune VLAs or train components, allowing models to learn from interaction and potentially exceed demonstrator performance. Challenges include stability and sample efficiency with large models. E.g., [iRe-VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16664) (iterative RL/SFT), [MoRE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08007) (RL objective for MoE VLAs handling mixed data), [RPD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05833) (RL-based policy distillation), ConRFT (RL fine-tuning with consistency policies), [SafeVLA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03480) (Constrained RL for safety).

* **Pre-training & Fine-tuning:** Standard approach, involving pre-training on large datasets (web data for VLM backbones, large robot datasets like OpenX for VLAs) and then fine-tuning on specific tasks or robots.

* **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):** Techniques like LoRA to efficiently adapt large VLAs without retraining the entire model, crucial for practical deployment and customization. [MoRE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08007) uses LoRA modules as experts.

* **Distillation:** Training smaller, faster models (students) to mimic the behavior of larger, slower models (teachers). 
E.g., [RPD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05833) (distilling a VLA to an RL policy), [OneDP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21257) (distilling a diffusion policy).

* **Curriculum Learning:** Structuring the learning process, e.g., by embodiment complexity. 
E.g., [DexVLA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05855) uses embodied curriculum.

* **Learning from Mixed-Quality Data:** Using techniques (e.g., RL in MoRE) to learn effectively even when demonstration data is suboptimal or contains failures.

* **Bridging Imitation and Interaction:** While Imitation Learning (IL) on large-scale datasets like OpenX is foundational for creating general-purpose VLAs, 
there's a growing trend towards combining it with interactive learning (RL) for fine-tuning and improvement. This hybrid approach aims to leverage the broad knowledge of IL datasets while overcoming IL's limitations (suboptimality, dataset cost) by enabling robots to adapt and potentially surpass human demonstrators through environmental interaction. The challenge lies in making RL stable and efficient for large VLA models. This trend indicates a direction towards combining the strengths of both: broad generalization via large-scale IL pre-training, and targeted refinement and adaptation via efficient and stable RL fine-tuning.

#### Input Modalities & Grounding

Focuses on input data types beyond standard RGB images and text used by VLAs, and how they ground these inputs.

* **Integrating Speech:** Control via spoken commands, potentially capturing nuances missed by text. Requires handling the speech modality directly or via ASR. E.g., [VLAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13508) (direct integration), Shake-VLA (uses external STT/TTS).

* **Integrating 3D Vision:** Using point clouds, voxels, depth maps, or implicit representations (NeRFs, 3DGS) to provide richer spatial understanding. E.g., 3D-VLA, PerAct, Act3D, RVT, RVT-2, RoboUniView, DP3, 3D Diffuser Actor, LEO, 3D-LLM, LLM-Grounder, [SpatialVLA](https://spatialvla.github.io/).

* **Integrating Proprioception / State:** Incorporating the robot's own state (joint angles, velocities, end-effector pose) as input. Common in many policies, explicitly mentioned in [VLAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13508), [PaLM-E](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03378), [Ï€0](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0) (evaluation requires Simpler fork with proprioception support). OpenVLA initially lacked this, noted as a limitation/future work.

* **Multimodal Prompts:** Handling instructions that include images or video in addition to text. E.g., [VIMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03094).

* **Grounding:** The process of linking language descriptions or visual perceptions to specific entities, locations, or actions in the physical world or robot representation. Addressed via various techniques like similarity matching, leveraging common-sense knowledge, multimodal alignment, or interaction. LLM-Grounder focuses on open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding.

* **The Need for Richer World Representations:** The increasing integration of 3D vision and speech indicates that standard RGB images and text may be insufficient for robust, nuanced robot interaction in complex environments. 3D data provides crucial spatial context missing from 2D images, while speech offers a more natural HRI modality. This trend suggests that future VLAs will become truly "multi-sensory" agents, moving beyond just vision and language. The VLA paradigm is expanding beyond its name ("Vision-Language-Action") to incorporate the richer sensory inputs (3D, speech, proprioception) needed for effective manipulation and interaction in the complex physical world, moving towards more general-purpose multimodal embodied agents.

Benchmarks (CALVIN, ManiSkill) drive standardized evaluation. However, the cost of real-world data collection and the persistent sim-to-real gap remain major bottlenecks, driving research into data augmentation, sim-to-real techniques, data-efficient learning, and automated data collection. The ecosystem of models, datasets, simulators, and benchmarks co-evolves, with limitations in one area (e.g., real data cost) driving innovation in others (e.g., simulation, data efficiency). Overcoming data/simulation limitations is key to unlocking the potential of VLAs.

## Challenges and Future Directions

* **Data Efficiency & Scalability:** Reducing reliance on massive, expensive, expert-driven datasets. Improving the ability to learn from limited, mixed-quality, or internet-sourced data. Efficiently scaling models and training processes. 

    * Future directions: Improved sample efficiency (RL, self-supervision), sim-to-real transfer, automated data generation, efficient architectures (SSMs, MoEs), data filtering/weighting.
* **Inference Speed & Real-Time Control:** Current large VLAs may be too slow for the high-frequency control loops needed for dynamic tasks or dexterous manipulation. 

    * Future directions: Smaller/compact models ([TinyVLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12514)), efficient architectures (RoboMamba), parallel decoding ([PD-VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02310)), action chunking optimization ([FAST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09747)), model distillation ([OneDP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21257), [RPD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05833) ), hardware acceleration.
* **Robustness & Reliability:** Ensuring consistent performance across variations in environment, lighting, object appearance, disturbances, and unexpected events. Current models can be brittle. 

    * Future directions: Adversarial training, improved grounding, better 3D understanding, closed-loop feedback, anomaly detection, incorporating physical priors, testing frameworks (VLATest).
* **Generalization:** Improving the ability to generalize to new tasks, objects, instructions, environments, and embodiments beyond the training distribution. This is a core promise of VLAs, but remains a challenge. 

    * Future directions: Training on more diverse data (OpenX), effective utilization of VLM pre-training knowledge, compositional reasoning, continual/lifelong learning, better action representations.
* **Safety & Alignment:** Explicitly incorporating safety constraints to prevent harm to the robot, the environment, or humans. Ensuring alignment with user intent. Crucial for real-world deployment. 

    * Future directions: Constrained reinforcement learning ([SafeVLA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03480)), formal verification, human oversight mechanisms, robust failure detection/recovery, ethical considerations.
* **Dexterity & Contact-Rich Tasks:** Improving performance on tasks requiring fine motor skills, precise force control, and handling complex object interactions. Current VLAs often lag behind specialized methods in this area. 

    * Future directions: Better action representations ([FAST](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09747), Diffusion), integration of tactile sensing, improved physical understanding/simulation, hybrid control approaches.
* **Reasoning & Long-Horizon Planning:** Enhancing the ability for multi-step reasoning, long-horizon planning, and handling complex instructions. 

    * Future directions: Hierarchical architectures, explicit planning modules, chain-of-thought reasoning (visual/textual), memory mechanisms, world models.
* **Multimodality Expansion:** Integrating richer sensory inputs beyond vision + language, such as audio/speech, touch, force, 3D. 

    * Future directions: Developing architectures and alignment techniques for diverse modalities.
* **The Tension Between Generalization and Specialization/Performance:** While a core promise of VLAs is to leverage large pre-trained models for generalization, achieving high success rates on specific, complex, or novel tasks often requires significant fine-tuning or specialized components. This creates a tension: how to achieve expert-level performance while maintaining broad generalization? 
Future research needs to balance general capabilities with task-specific proficiency, potentially through more effective adaptation techniques (e.g., [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft)), modular architectures (e.g., MoEs), or methods that combine general priors with task-specific learning.
